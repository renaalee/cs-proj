ABSURDIST POOL

This is a game of pool built with python and pygame.
Each of the 15 game balls behave differently upon collision with other balls and the game boundary.
The goal of the game is to guide each ball into one of six targets as quickly as possible.

The arrow keys guide the control ball, the space bar shoots the control ball, and B brakes it.
Guiding the control ball into a target results in a penalty of extra time added to the timer.

Q allows one to quit the game.
W is an automatic-win cheat.
